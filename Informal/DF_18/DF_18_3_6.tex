\begin{prob}
    Let \( G \) be a finite group.
    Let \( \phi: G\rightarrow \GL(V) \) be a representation with character \( \psi \) over \( \CC \).
    Let \( W \) be the subspace \( \{v\in V \mid \mbox{\( \phi(g)(v) = v  \) for all \( g\in G \)}\} \)
    of \( V \) fixed pointwise by all elements of \( G \). Prove that \( \dim W = (\psi, \chi_1) \),
    where \( \chi_1 \) is the principal character of \( G \).
