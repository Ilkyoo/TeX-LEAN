Let $R$ be a local ring. Assume that $M$ is the maximal ideal of $R$. Prove that if $x \in R$ and $x \notin M$ then $x$ is a unit.


Let $G$ be a group. Assume that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ with index $n$. Prove that there exists a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$ such that $K$ is a subgroup of $H$ and $|G : K | \le n!$.
